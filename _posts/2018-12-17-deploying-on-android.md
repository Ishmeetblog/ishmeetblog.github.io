**To deploy an apk to android devices from unity we need the following:**

- The latest version of Unity (available here)
- An Android device running the latest version of Android
- The Simple Mobile Placeholder project (available from the Asset Store)


**First, let’s take a quick look at the Simple Mobile Placeholder project. As the name suggests, this is an intentionally minimal project - it was created simply to test the build process. As such, it’s very easy to test that it has built correctly and that it runs as expected on your device.**

- Open Unity and create a new project.
- Name the project "SimpleMobilePlaceholder".
- Choose a location to save it to.
- Ensure that "3D" is selected to use the Unity Editor in 3D mode.
- Click the Create project button to create the project.
