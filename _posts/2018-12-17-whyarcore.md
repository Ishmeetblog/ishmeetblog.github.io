title: why we choose to work with arcore
---


Ever noticed why most augmented reality apps require you to more your camera around the room to detect surfaces? This is because the app needs to build a world of its own. ARCore is no different.

When you move your phone around, ARCore memorizes the surroundings and builds a world of its own in which it can place virtual objects. It uses motion tracking technology to identify certain features which allow it to keep a track of how these points move in accordance with your camera movements.

This is why when you place a virtual object in your room and go out and come back, the object is still there!! ARCore has built an understanding of the environment and built a virtual world where it remembers where each feature is located.

When you place an object, it calculates itâ€™s position in relation to the other objects and when you come back to the same place, the object is rendered again.
