Motion tracking in arcore

The mobile hardware can be Bradly categorised into 3 categories based on their functionality:-

1. Hardware that enables motion tracking
1. Hardware that enables location based AR
1. Hardware that enables view of real world with AR

## Hardware that enables Motion Tracking

- **Accelerometer**: Measures acceleration, which is speed divided by time. Simply put, it’s the measure of change in velocity. Acceleration forces can be static/continuous — like gravity — or dynamic, such as movement or vibrations.
- 
- **Gyroscope**: Measures and/or maintains orientation and angular velocity. When you change the rotation of your phone while using an AR experience, the gyroscope measures that rotation and ARCore ensures that the digital assets respond correctly.
- 
- **Phone Camera:** With mobile AR, your phone camera supplies a live feed of the surrounding real world upon which AR content is overlaid. In addition to the camera itself, ARCore-capable phones like the Google Pixel rely on complementary technologies like machine learning, complex image processing, and computer vision to produce high-quality images and spatial maps for mobile AR.



## Hardware that enables location-based AR


**Magnetometer:** Gives smartphones a simple orientation related to the Earth’s magnetic field. Because of the magnetometer, your phone always knows which direction is North, allowing it to auto-rotate digital maps depending on your physical orientation. This device is key to location-based AR apps.

**GPS:**  global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver, like in your smartphone. For ARCore-capable smartphones, this device helps enable location-based AR apps.




## Hardware that enables view of real world with AR


Display: the display on your smartphone is important for crisp imagery and displaying 3D rendered assets. For instance, Google Pixel XL’s display specification is 5.5" AMOLED QHD (2560 x 1440) 534ppi display, which means that the phone can display 534 pixels per inch — making for rich, vivid images.
