## How is Arcore Superior from others

ARCore is very mature and well tested software.it’s had at least 2 years more development inside Google than ARkit had inside Apple, and there’s a rich roadmap of features that were lined up for Tango, not all of which depend on 3D depth data, that will now find their way into ARCore.

if you added depth camera sensor hardware to a phone which runs ARCore, you’d have a Tango phone. Now Google has a much easier path to get wide adoption of the SDK by being able to ship it on the OEM flagship phones. No one would give up a great android phone for a worse one with AR (same as no one would give up any great phone for a Windows Mobile phone with AR, so MSFT didn’t bother, they went straight to a Head Mounted Display). Now people will buy the phone they would have bought anyway, and ARCore will be pulled along for free.
